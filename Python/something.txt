Hence! Home, you idle creatures, get you home!

MARULLUS 
Where is thy leather apron and thy rule?
What dost thou with thy best apparel on?—

MARULLUS 
But what trade art thou? Answer me directly.
COBBLER A trade, sir, that I hope I may use with a safe
conscience, which is indeed, sir, a mender of bad
soles.
